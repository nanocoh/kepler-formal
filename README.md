# kepler-formal

## Introduction

Kepler-Formal is a logic equivalence checking (LEC) tool that operates on the naja interchange format(https://github.com/najaeda/naja-if). It is designed for verifying incremental edits produced by the najaeda Python library(https://pypi.org/project/najaeda/) or any workflow that preserves stable indices across modifications so that corresponding items retain the same identifiers. Kepler-Formal focuses today on combinational equivalence checking only — sequential boundary changes are not supported yet and remain planned work.

## Dependencies

Mandatory dependencies:

1. Boost
2. [cmake](https://cmake.org): at least 3.22 version.
For system-specific cmake installation options, please refer to [this link](https://cmake.org/download/).
3. Python3: for building the SNL Python3 interface. This interface is used to load primitive cells (associated to Verilog parsing)
and their associated characteristics (for instance: ressource count, timing characteristics, ...).

Optional dependencies:

1. [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl): for the documentation generation.

Embedded dependencies, through git sub modules:

1. [naja-verilog](https://github.com/najaeda/naja-verilog): for verilog parsing.
2. [google test](https://github.com/google/googletest) for unit testing.

On Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get install g++ libboost-dev python3.9-dev capnproto libcapnp-dev libtbb-dev pkg-config bison flex doxygen
```

On macOS, using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install cmake doxygen capnp tbb bison flex boost
```

Ensure the versions of `bison` and `flex` installed via Homebrew take precedence over the macOS defaults by modifying your $PATH environment variable as follows:

```bash
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/flex/bin:/opt/homebrew/opt/bison/bin:$PATH"
```
